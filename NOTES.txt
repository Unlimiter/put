* 'put' is written in C++, and that means it's slower than 'echo' up to some point; echo is written in C. Plus, you can give arguments to 'echo' without having to worry about argument limits, while 'put' is more limited on arguments number than 'echo'.
* Although 'put' supports escape sequences, it doesn't support "\NNN", "\xNN", "\uNNNN" and "\UNNNNNNNN" yet. I'll work on supporting them before the first stable release; I had to go to sleep at the time of writing.
